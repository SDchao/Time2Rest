# Time2Rest

## Chinese Version

请前往 [README](https://github.com/SDchao/Time2Rest/blob/main/README.md)

## Software Function

Time2Rest can help you protect your eyes! When you have kept using your computer for over 30 minutes (can be set), transparent reminder, which tells you current time and the time you using the computer, will show up in the screen.

When the reminder shows, you can choose to rest at least 20 seconds (can be set too). After that, just shake your mouse or type something and it's gone!

If you dismiss the reminder, it will remind you again 1 minute later (also can be set)

You can rest on your own through the menu to reset the 30 minute countdown. Leaving mouse and keyboard for 5 minutes can achieve that too.

If fullscreen application is running, the reminder will not show up. Of course, it can be adjusted in settings! No problem!

## Customization

Time2Rest can customize the UI! FANTASTIC!

You can choose the text color, background color. Single color is too dull? All right! You can set image background, just like that:

## How it works

Time2Rest will monitor your keyboard and mouse to judge if you are using your computer.

Relax! Time2Rest **WILL NOT** record or upload your keyboard history and mouse history! You can check that part of source code anytime:
